<div class="post-body p-t-6rem">
    <p>So you have a great business idea and now all you need to do is find the perfect developer team to make it come to life. When you start your search, you will be bombarded by all sorts of quotations. But how do you know which engagement model to choose? Let us help you understand the difference!</p>
    <p>There are three common engagement models for outsourcing your IT needs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Team (DT).</strong> Hiring a dedicated team is perfect if you have a large-scale project in mind or when you need constant access to a team of developers for a period of at least 6 months.</li>
        <li><strong>Time & Material Model (TM).</strong> This model is best suited for long-term projects if their scope and resources are hard to define and could be altered on the go.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed Price Model (FP).</strong> If you have a clear understanding of the amount of time and resources your project requires, go for this clear and efficient model.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why Do You Need a Dedicated Team?</h3><br>
    <p>The Dedicated Team Model has become extremely popular across many industries, including eCommerce, Finance, Big Data and even Education. It's actually no wonder, seeing as this model possesses numerous advantages. We'll just name a few for you to get a general idea why having a virtual dedicated team is such a trend today.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You can choose the members of the team and have full control over every decision, the same way as you can control your in-house employees.</li>
        <li>Through Agile approach, you get a very clear idea of the time and resources needed for the project.</li>
        <li>Everyday contact with project manager and team members allows you to get updates on the project status and to request necessary changes.</li>
        <li>You can rely on the dedicated team members to make the best decisions, due to their profound understanding of your business needs and goals developed over your time working together.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>At the same time, keep in mind, that hiring your personal dedicated team will cost you more than completing an average Time & Material project. You should also be ready to take an active part in your project's development from the process of choosing team members through constant updates and negotiations till the final launch. This may lead to delays in the development process compared to the TM model.</p>
    <p>Seeing as the dedicated team model is in-demand today, let's take a closer look at how it works. First, you should realize there are three DT options for you to choose from.</p>
    <h3>Hourly Hire</h3><br>
    <p>If your project is not overly complicated and does not require too much time, hourly payment model will be the most cost-effective solution for you. This model entails dividing the project into small prioritized steps. Due to a constant stream of updates, you get to reevaluate the tasks and alter any part of the project along the way. Using cutting edge project management programs we track all the activities of the team, so you can get a full picture of how the valuable development time is spent. The total payment for the project is calculated based on the hourly rate and the number of hours it takes to complete.</p>
    <h3>Full-Time or Part-Time Hire</h3><br>
    <p>These two options are very similar and the only difference is the amount of time our developers spend working on your project. Both options give you unrestricted access to the employees you hire: designers, project managers, developers, and testers. It's like having your own development team but without the need to supply office space and other resources. If you choose a full-time option, the team of your choosing will work for you 5 days a week and 8 hours per day. You get maximum control over their work, assigning tasks and checking progress till the project is complete.</p> 
    <p>The part-time option is basically the same, only the number of hours the team works on your tasks is lower. If you don't need developers to devote 8 hours to your project daily, there is no reason to pay more. It's a win-win situation, as you spend less money and our team can work on other tasks at the same time without compromising on the quality of either project.</p>
    <h3>How Does It Work?</h3><br>
    <p>Decided to hire yourself a dedicated team? What do you do next?</p>
    <p>First, you need to contact the customer manager. This way you'll get more information about the engagement models provided by the development team of your choice. The manager will also gather info on your requirements needed to accurately estimate the scope of the project and choose the resources best suited to your needs.</p>
    <p>Second, pick the members of your dedicated team. According to your requirements, you will be offered the developers, designers, and testers best suited to your needs. You'll get an idea of their skill sets based on their portfolios. Youâ€™ll get to contact every one of the future team members to judge their capabilities.</p>
    <p>Third, when the team is assembled, developers will start working on your project under the guidance of the project manager. You will be able to monitor constantly the project's progress and contact team members for updates.</p>
