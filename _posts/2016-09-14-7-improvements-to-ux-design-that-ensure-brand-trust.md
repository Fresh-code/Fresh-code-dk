    <h3>Why would you need your customers to trust you?</h3><br>
    <p>If you wish to uphold the good reputation and turn every client into a regular, trust is exactly what you need. Trust means that your clients believe you won't trick them or lie in the product description while knowing your company is a reliable partner.</p>
    <p>So how does UX design influence your brand trust? You might not be aware of it, but every bit of UX design can make a difference. Read on to learn more.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How Can Design Generate Regular Customers for You?</h3><br>
    <p>Imagine yourself on a trip to a city you've never been to. You're alone, tired and hungry after a long journey, but suddenly you see an inviting Subway sign. It beckons you to come in, take a seat and enjoy a sandwich. Even if you're not a fan of Subway, you know it's a place to go to when you need a filling snack.</p>
    <p>And if you are already a regular the Subway can be your home away from home anywhere you go. Thanks to a consistent menu, design and branding, you'll feel welcome at any of the numerous diners around the world. And that is exactly what makes customers come back for more. Fast food chains have used this principle for decades to lure clients in with the same interior design and menus around the globe. Even if people realize this marketing strategy they still can't resist their urges.</p>
    <p>These are the principles you can use to create a constant stream of regular customers with just a few tricks to improve UX design of your site or application.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Five Tricks to Build Brand Trust with UX Design</h3><br>
    <p><strong>Be honest.</strong> That's rule number one, that applies to any relationship and your customer dealings are no exception. Do not mislead your clients with stock photos of huge offices if your company is based in a garage for now. Even the smallest lie can lead to distrust and consequently to you losing not only existing but also potential customers due to a light speed travel of the word of mouth.</p>
    <p><strong>Fulfill clients' needs.</strong> While considering UX design keep in mind your customers' purpose to visit your site or use your application. If the client needs access to some information, don't make him jump through the hoops to find it. If any action can be achieved by one click, do not complicate it unnecessarily by adding five additional pages your client must go through. Keep user experience design simple and streamlined.</p>
    <p><strong>Deliver quality content.</strong> Show your customers that you are truly an expert in your field ready to share valuable information with regulars. Quality content allows you to build brand trust by creating an authoritative image for your company and get a competitive advantage over dozens of business rivals.</p>
    <p><strong>Become mobile-friendly.</strong> Mobile traffic is consistently increasing every year and you should use this trend to your advantage. There's no need to create a separate version of the web-site, it will only increase maintenance cost and create a separate set of inconsistencies and other problems. Use responsive design so that your site or application showcases consistent design through all the platforms: desktop, and mobile.</p>
    <p><strong>Get rid of distractions.</strong> Avoid using too many pop-up windows, advertisement and other distracting features that steal attention away from valuable information. Small but annoying bugs like broken links should be eliminated ruthlessly. These problems, when combined, create an unreliable image and get your brand associated with negative emotions such as aggravation and irritation. Instead, make your customers want to return again providing the smooth and distraction-free design.</p>
    <p><strong>Ensure customersâ€™ security.</strong> When you ask people to provide personal information and especially credit card data, you need to make them feel safe. Clearly stating the payment methods as well as security protocols in place to prevent fraud or identity theft is a must. Use well-recognized symbols, like locks and seals to make your customers feel protected and secure.</p>
    <p><strong>Skip out on the use of Dark Patterns.</strong> User interface designed to trick customers into doing something they do not wish to accomplish is known as Dark Pattern. Such practices can lure businessmen with additional profits, but they will kill your business in the long run. Hard-earned trust can be instantly destroyed by the Dark Pattern never to be gained back. Using Dark Patterns you can forget about gaining any regular clients, as no one wishes to be tricked twice.</p>
    <p>Site or an application are the only ways many of the customers can get to know your company and learn to trust you. Be wise in choosing the best user experience models for building brand trust and you will be rewarded with happy and grateful customers for years to come. And we don't need to tell you that regulars translate into the increase in revenue.</p>
