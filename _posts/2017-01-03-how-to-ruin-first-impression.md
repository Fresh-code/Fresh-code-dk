<p>First impressions are important. Even the scientists have finally agreed that first impressions are spot on most of the time. So when you go looking for a software company to develop your newest project, listen to your gut and listen carefully to what is actually being said. There are some phrases professional development teams will never use. Let’s see what separates great developers from mediocre.</p>
<br>
<h2>“We Have Received Your Request Five Days Ago”</h2>
<br>
<p>It is a safe bet that after five days of radio silence you have already moved on and found yourself a team. If that is not the case, ignore the late response and consider other choices.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to request a quotation and hear back in less than 10 minutes? Of course, no one can analyze your needs and prepare for the first meeting on such a short notice. But even a small note saying “We have received your request and will get on it right away” would make you feel special. It means that the company is likely to keep you in the loop during the development process and you will be able to get a quick response for any of your questions and requests.</p>
<br>
<h2>“We Are a Team of Experienced Professionals” or “No One Else Will Help You”</h2>
<br>
<p>The first contact is notoriously difficult for both parties, but you need to make the most of your limited time. It’s too early to talk business, but you can ask all the questions about the company’s inner workings, its principles, and mission, the ways it gets through rough patches of the development process.</p>
<p>Look out for vague descriptions and platitudes. Your consultant should be informative but not unnecessarily talkative. Beware of unfounded self-glorification, ask for proofs of any achievements the company representative brings to your attention, otherwise, discard them as likely false.</p>
<br>
<h2>“We Are Ready to Start Immediately, No Questions Asked”</h2>
<br>
<p>If the consultant doesn’t spare time to get to know the specifics of your project, look out. It might cause you extra expense in the future when it turns out that the scope of your project was off the mark or that your requirements weren’t fully met.</p>
<p>True professionals will always ask you a million of questions regarding your business goals and needs. This questioning might seem unnecessary, but you will understand your project a lot better after answering. Initiative and a keen interest in your idea are the qualities you should seek in an outsourcing software company.</p>
<br>
<h2>“We Offer the Only Right Solution”</h2>
<br>
<p>If you hear that there’s only one way to solve your problem, smile and politely decline. Even the most complex problems can be solved  in two different ways at least.</p>
<p>Qualified developers will always provide you with several possible options and will outline the benefits and shortcomings of each. Based on their expertise and advice, you will be able to make the right choice and not settle for the option someone else deems the best for you.</p>
<br>
<h2>“Your Project is Unique and There Has Never Been Anything Alike”</h2>
<br>
<p>Hearing this might boost your ego, but it is usually a sign that the software company simply doesn’t have experience in the industry you want to conquer. Ask yourself if flattery is more important to you than success. If not, choose another company.</p>
<p>In most cases, you can browse the company’s website portfolio and look for similar projects yourself. If you haven’t found any, your consultant should provide you with examples of analogous projects.</p>
<br>
<h2>“Are You Crazy? This is Impossible!”</h2>
<br>
<p>Even if everything else seems fine, but you don’t feel that your consultant is mature enough or doesn’t follow professional etiquette, feel free to look elsewhere. You might get to know the development team very well while working on your project, but that does not give anyone the right to treat you disrespectfully, especially if it is your first meeting.</p>
<p>Besides, you need a team that is optimistic enough to finish your project, even if the task seems nearly impossible. The company that gives up without even trying is not worth your time.<br />
Now you know all the main red flags you should look out for when looking for a software company. Be ready to contact several companies before you finally find the perfect match. The search will be well worth it when your project is complete just the way you have envisioned it.</p>
