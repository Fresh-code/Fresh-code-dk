    Run from terminal build.sh script to publish site to github pages and update whole project.

    ./sh build.sh


START Jekyll:

    jekyll serve             - run jekyll server in watch mode, checking changes in your files and rebuild site in _site folder, serving site on localhost:4000
    jekyll serve --no-watch  - run jekyll server dont make any changes if someone changes, serving site on localhost:4000
    jekyll build             - generate site in _site folder without serving site

                                !!!!!!! Important !!!!!!!
    jekyll build && jekyll serve - run every time when work with portfolio.js/blog.js in js/ folder, and re-run this
                                   command when change something in that file.

    Because in this js files store and compile data from jekyll. First step compile file in _site/js folder in portfolio.js/blog.js then it
    minify in portfolio.min.js/blog.min.js. To compile this file you must change some thing (add whitespace, new line, etc.) in js/portfolio.js or js/blog.js
    In that way you can change output file such as _site/js/portfolio.min.js or _site/js/blog.min.js.

    Adaptive Images:

        This is jekyll custom module. You can find them in site folder `_plugin`.
        1. adaptive_images.rb
        2. adaptive_images_generator.rb

        adaptive_images.rb is Liquid::Tag module. Create adaptive image from source file with specified parameters.

            {% adaptive_image /path/to/image.jpg size="value" sizes="value" [attr="value"] %}
                size - img width
                sizes - you can set the image size, depending on the display settings.
            e.g.
            {% adaptive_image {{ site.data.right-side-layout.data-parser.images[1] }} size="1070 400" sizes="min 1000 1070;max 999 400" class="img-responsive" draggable="false" alt="screenshot" title="screenshot %}

            <img class="img-responsive" draggable="false" alt="data-parser screenshot" title="data-parser screenshot"
                 src="/img/data-parser/application-400.png 400w"
              srcset="/img/data-parser/application-1070.png 1070w,
                      /img/data-parser/application-400.png 400w"
