  "challenges": "Twenty One Learning interactive platform is an educational project, similar to Google Docs and Google Presentation. The main objective of the project was to allow collaborative creation of lectures, presentations, slides and text with open access to all materials.",
  "buisValue": "At first, TwentyOne Learning was but a start-up, but it is currently almost ready for a full-scale launch. Educational platform was first revealed at the Bett 2015 expo, where TwentyOne Learning received positive feedback and got several partnership offers. Communication with LearnPad Company are now in progress regarding the plans to preinstall the platform tablet PCs.",
  "solutions": "We developed a unique module Operational Transform Java Implementation that allowed for the simultaneous editing for up to 100 people while presentation download time decreased to 3 seconds. An original framework for the PDF files import was developed for the project along with audio and video support. The platform supports a simultaneous load of 100.000 users and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud server solution creates a possibility of the infrastructure scaling.",
