  "challenges": "FloTron is a multichannel control and monitoring system for manufacturing processes that uses a hardware device connected to a series of peripheral units. Nova Fabrica Ltd. needed to add Graphic User Interface (GUI) to a working system to allow users remote real-time access to the data via Internet connection. Two main difficulties for GUI development included a large number of reference points and their synchronization with displayed data.",
  "buisValue": "GUI introduction widened FloTron functionality and perfected its usability. It has led to a huge increase in sales and many customers have already left positive feedback.",
  "solutions": "It took our team of seven three months to develop GUI for the FloTron system. GUI allows for constant real-time manufacturing processes and plasma ejection monitoring along with optical radiation spectrometry. Monitoring any channel users vary scale, graph type and change statistics settings. System settings can be imported and exported for different users.",
